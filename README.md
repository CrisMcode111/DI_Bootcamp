# DI Bootcamp – Coursework Repository

This repository contains **all exercises, notebooks, and assignments** completed during the DI AI Bootcamp.

It serves as an **academic record and learning log**, documenting progression across multiple topics such as:
- Python & data analysis
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Model evaluation and experimentation
- Applied AI mini-projects

The code is intentionally kept close to its original form to reflect the learning process throughout the bootcamp.

> Note: Selected projects developed during the bootcamp are maintained in separate repositories for clarity.
