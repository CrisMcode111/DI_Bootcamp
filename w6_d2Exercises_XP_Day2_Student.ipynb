        "## 🌟 Exercise 3: Benefits and Ethics of Pre-training\n",
        "- Benefits (explain each in your words):\n",
        "  1) Improved generalization: Pre-training helps a model understand general language patterns before learning a specific task.\n",
        "Because it has already seen millions of examples, it can recognize grammar, meanings, and relationships between words.\n",
        "This makes it easier for the model to perform well on new or unseen data, even when it wasn’t trained directly on it.\n",
        "In short — it “learns how to learn” and can adapt faster to different problems.\n",
        "  2) Less labeled data: Pre-training allows models to learn a lot from unlabeled text, like articles or conversations, before fine-tuning.\n",
        "When we later train them on a specific task (like spam detection or translation), they already “know” language patterns.\n",
        "This means we need much fewer labeled examples, saving time and effort because labeling data is expensive and slow.\n",
        "The model reuses its previous knowledge instead of starting from zero.\n",
        "  3) Faster fine-tuning: Faster fine-tuning:\n",
        "Because the model is already trained on a huge amount of text, it starts with a good understanding of language.\n",
        "When we fine-tune it for a specific task, it only needs to adjust slightly — not learn everything from the beginning.\n",
        "This makes the training process much faster and requires less computing power.\n",
        "It’s like teaching someone who already speaks the language, instead of starting from zero.\n",
        "  4) Transfer learning: Transfer learning means taking a model that was already trained on one big, general task and reusing it for another, smaller task.\n",
        "The model “transfers” its language knowledge — grammar, meaning, and context — to new problems like sentiment analysis or question answering.\n",
        "This saves a lot of time and data because we don’t need to train a new model from scratch every time.\n",
        "It helps achieve good results even when the new dataset is small.\n",
        "  5) Robustness: Pre-trained models are more stable and reliable because they’ve already seen many types of text, topics, and writing styles.\n",
        "This helps them handle spelling mistakes, slang, or unusual phrasing better than models trained on small datasets.\n",
        "They don’t get confused as easily by noise or rare words.\n",
        "In short, pre-training makes models more resistant to errors and better at understanding real-world language.\n",

        "- Ethical concerns: TODO (bias, misinformation, misuse, privacy) Pre-trained models learn from huge amounts of text collected from the internet — and that text often includes biases, stereotypes, and misinformation.\n",
        "As a result, the model can accidentally repeat or amplify unfair or false ideas.\n",
        "There is also a risk of misuse, like generating fake news or harmful content.\n",
        "Another problem is privacy, since training data may contain personal information that should not be exposed.\n",
        "That’s why developers must carefully check data sources and apply filters or ethical rules before using these models.\n",
        "- Mitigations: TODO (data curation, differential privacy, safety filters, RLHF, audits)\n",
        "To reduce ethical risks, developers use several safety methods.\n",
        "Data curation helps by cleaning and selecting high-quality, diverse, and unbiased text sources.\n",
        "Differential privacy protects personal data during training, so individual information cannot be traced.\n",
        "Safety filters and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) teach the model to avoid toxic, biased, or unsafe outputs.\n",
        "Regular audits and evaluations help detect problems early and keep the system transparent and responsible.\n",
        "Together, these steps make modern NLP models safer and more trustworthy."

        "The model compares every Query with all Keys to measure how strongly each word should pay attention to the others.\n",
        "These similarity scores are scaled and passed through a softmax function to turn them into attention weights (they sum to 1).\n",
        "The weights are then used to mix the Value vectors — this gives a new representation for each word that includes information from its context.\n",

        "Each head learns a different subspace projection of the input — for example, one head may focus on grammar, another on meaning, and another on long-distance dependencies.\n",
        "By combining these diverse attention patterns, the model captures richer and more complex relationships between words.\n",

        "- When to prefer MLM vs CLM: TODO Choose MLM when the goal is to understand text, not generate it — for example in classification, sentiment analysis, or question answering.\n",
        "MLM helps the model see the full context (both sides) of each word, which improves comprehension and representation quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose CLM when the goal is to generate text — like chatbots, translation, story writing, or code generation.\n",
        "CLM trains the model to think “forward,” predicting the next word naturally, which makes it fluent and coherent in generation tasks.\n",
        "- NSP: TODO (why early BERT used it and why many modern models avoid it)NSP (Next Sentence Prediction):\n",
        "Early BERT models used NSP to help the model understand relationships between sentences — for example, whether one sentence logically follows another.\n",
        "This was useful for tasks like question answering or natural language inference, where sentence connections matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, later research showed that NSP did not significantly improve performance and sometimes even confused the model, because it focused too much on predicting sequence order instead of deeper meaning.\n",
