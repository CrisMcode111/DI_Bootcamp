        "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like LoRA, address the challenges of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by only updating a small subset of the model’s parameters. This approach significantly reduces computational and storage costs, making LLM fine-tuning more accessible. PEFT techniques allow developers to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks without retraining the entire model, leading to faster development cycles and reduced resource consumption.\n",
